TAIFA-1 (“one nation” in Swahili), will be launched into orbit aboard SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. In addition, the nanosatellite is scheduled for launch in Q4 2022. In the past decade, East Africa has been hit with heavy droughts and wildfires, leading to recurring water crises, and damages to local agriculture and food supplies. TAIFA-1 will feature a hyperspectral, Earth-observation camera that will empower customers with relevant environmental, wildlife, and agricultural monitoring as well as land use mapping data in the fight against natural disasters. In addition, EnduroSat and SayariLabs signed an MOU, which is another milestone for the successful partnership and upcoming joint space projects of the two companies. To this end, EnduroSat organised a two-week educational training for SayariLab’s engineering team, dedicated to space systems and engineering, covering all aspects of mission analysis, design, and spacecraft assembly. “Over the past decades, space and satellite industries have been reserved for the wealthy and mighty. However, SayariLabs is on a mission of democratising these industries for all interested players in the African region and in making Kenya a space giant in the next generation. With the advancement of technology, this fantasy is quickly becoming a reality. Our partnership with EnduroSat, a leading company in this industry, is a major game-changer and it strengthens our hope and belief of being a major space and satellite solution provider in Kenya, the African region and other parts of the world.” Aaron Nzau, Founder & CEO SayariLabs. “I am really proud to have the opportunity to support SayariLabs in their efforts to bring space closer to thousands of people in Kenya. Working alongside their team has been an amazing experience for us and I cannot wait to see the innovations and the positive impact that they plan to have, realized in practice. EnduroSat has been for a long time a true believer in open, responsible and accessible space and this is yet another step in this direction.” Raycho Raychev, Founder & CEO EnduroSat.
