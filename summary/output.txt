Larger display, but small pack size, not only sounds practical, it is too. If you want to stand out from the crowd with your smartphone, you can use the foldable. The folding smartphones are still a young device class, the first model only came onto the market at the end of 2018. With the third generation, foldables became more suitable for everyday use, more robust and more useful. There are essentially two types of folding smartphones: One is folded up for transport and is therefore particularly small and handy with a display surface that is otherwise comparable to conventional smartphones, while the other folders become almost a large tablet when they are opened.
The Gambia' Scorpions achieve a historic feat by winning their first match for their first appearance in AFCON finals. The RFC midfielder Seraing also entered the history of Gambian football, scoring the only goal of the match. First achievement for The Gambia in TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations, Cameroon 2021. The Scorpions started the game very strongly in Limbé, making the Mourabitounes doubt with a goal action from the tenth minute. Barrow found Ablie Jallow who controled the ball from the right before putting a dry strike with his left foot into the net of goalkeeper Diop Babacar. After this goal, the Mauritanians tried to get back to the mark and played very high, but the Gambian defense, well around their goalkeeper Jobe Modou annihilated all actions. Neither Ba Papa Ibnou, nor even Captain Aboubacar Kamara succeeded in breaking the wall of the Scorpions. After the break, the Mourabitounes played their game with forays to the sides, or collective combinations, but always in vain against Modou. Neither the intention of Fofana Gussouma's comrades, nor even the application and experience of Le Havre Ibnou were enough to set the record straight. On the other side, the charges of Tom Saintfiet played blocks and controled the ball to hold this first historic victory for the Scorpions.
Substitute Alexis Sanchez scored with the last kick of the match to help Inter Milan win the title of the Italian Super Cup with a 2-1 victory over bitter rival Juventus after extra time on Wednesday. Sanchez's goal, helped by an error from the Juventus defense, sparked scenes of wild celebration at San Siro as almost every member of the Inter bench ran onto the field to embrace Sanchez in the far corner. Lautaro Martinez had converted a penalty in the first half to cancel out American midfielder Weston McKennie's opener for Juventus in an entertaining game for the first piece of silverware of the season.
Having spent just over a month in space, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) is working and already zeroing in on some of the hottest, most energetic objects in the universe. A joint effort between NASA and the Italian Space Agency, IXPE is the first space observatory dedicated to studying the polarization of X-rays coming from objects like exploded stars and black holes. Polarization describes how the X-ray light is oriented as it travels through space. “The start of IXPE’s science observations marks a new chapter for X-ray astronomy,” said Martin Weisskopf, the mission’s principal investigator at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. “One thing is certain: we can expect the unexpected.” IXPE launched Dec. 9 on a Falcon 9 rocket into orbit 370 miles (600 kilometers) above Earth’s equator. The observatory’s boom, which provides the distance needed to focus X-rays onto its detectors, was deployed successfully on Dec. 15. The IXPE team spent the next three weeks checking out the observatory’s maneuvering and pointing abilities and aligning the telescopes. Over the course of these tests, the team pointed IXPE at two bright calibration targets: 1ES 1959+650, a black-hole-powered galaxy core with jets shooting into space; and SMC X-1, a spinning dead star, or pulsar. The brightness of these two sources made it easy for the IXPE team to see where X-rays are falling on IXPE’s polarization-sensitive detectors and make small adjustments to the telescopes’ alignment.
Volcanic ash left over from a huge ancient eruption has helped scientists determine that important early Homo sapiens fossils found in Ethiopia in 1967 are older than previously believed, providing fresh insight into the dawn of our species. Researchers said on Wednesday they used the geochemical fingerprints of a thick layer of ash found above the sediments containing the fossils to ascertain that it resulted from an eruption that spewed volcanic fallout over a wide swathe of Ethiopia roughly 233,000 years ago. Because the fossils were located beneath this ash, they predated the eruption, the researchers said, although by how many years remains unclear. It previously was believed the fossils were no more than about 200,000 years old. The fossils, called Omo I, were discovered in southwestern Ethiopia in a region called the Omo Kibish geological formation during an expedition led by the late paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey. They include a rather complete cranial vault and lower jaw, some vertebrae and parts of the arms and legs. Scientists have sought greater clarity about the timing of our species' origins in Africa.
Safaricom  has a huge pricing power in voice services, making it difficult for rivals Airtel Kenya and Telkom Kenya to compete with it, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) has said. The regulator made the disclosure in its response to a case filed by Safaricom at the Communications And Multimedia Appeals Tribunal seeking to stop CA from cutting the mobile termination rate (MTR) per minute to Sh0.12 from Sh0.99. MTRs are the charges levied by a mobile service provider on other telecommunications service providers for terminating calls on its network. Safaricom argues that the reduction of the charge, which was to take effect at the start of this year, ignores the cost of doing business in the telecommunications industry. The regulator responded by stating that the leading telco has the lowest cost of operations, allowing it to run promotions at prices below the MTR and which its rivals are not in a position to match. “In fact, in the years 2020 and 2021, the appellant (Safaricom) successfully ran a number of promotions and special offers targeting voice services where the effective discounted rate per minute for both on-net and off-net calls is as low as Sh0.2,” CA said in its submission. “Where the appellant prices its call rates below the Sh0.99 termination rate, it would be impossible for competitors to viably replicate such offers, given that they face the termination rate as a marginal cost.” The regulator added that it considers Safaricom’s ability to offer rates as low as Sh0.2 per minute an indication that the telco’s cost of production is much lower than Sh0.99, the rate prior to the contested revision. Safaricom has been running promotions and special offers that has seen it price its per-minute voice services at a range of between Sh0.2 and Sh1, according to an analysis by the regulator. In the telco’s “Stori Ibambe 500 percent bonus” promotion, for instance, subscribers paid an effective rate of Sh0.2 per minute in the offer that ran between October 12, 2021, and January 9, 2022. A customer, for example, got 150 minutes’ worth of talk time for Sh30. The fight over the contested MTR cut has divided players in the telecommunications sector based on who stands to lose or benefit from the decision. Safaricom’s leading market share has seen it charge its rivals more than it pays out to them, leaving it in a net profitable position. The regulator argues that Safaricom can absorb the 87.9 percent loss of revenue running into billions of shillings per annum.
Export earnings from tea grew by Sh16 billion or 13.3 percent last year, helped by higher volumes and a weaker shilling. The Tea Board of Kenya (TBK) puts earnings at Sh136 billion last year when compared with Sh120 billion that was recorded in 2020. The earnings came amid flat prices for the commodity, underlining the impact of higher export volumes. In the 10 months to October, for instance, the average auction price for Kenyan tea was unchanged with the same period of the previous year at $2.02 (Sh229). Tea producers also benefitted from the depreciation of the Kenya shilling which had lost ground to hit lows of 113 units to the US dollar by end of last year. “Export volumes stood at 558 million kgs of made tea against 518 million kgs in 2020 whilst tea export earnings amounted to Sh136 billion against Sh120 billion in 2020,” TBK reports. The board, however, notes that earnings from local tea consumption declined to Sh19 billion against Sh20 billion realised a year earlier.
SayariLabs, the first Kenyan space company and provider of satellite services and space-based solutions to governments, industries, and academic institutions in Africa and beyond and EnduroSat, a leading provider of software-defined NanoSats and space services for business and academia sign a commercial agreement to launch the first Kenyan 3U software-defined NanoSat dubbed “TAIFA-1”.
TAIFA-1 (“one nation” in Swahili), will be launched into orbit aboard SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. In addition, the nanosatellite is scheduled for launch in Q4 2022. In the past decade, East Africa has been hit with heavy droughts and wildfires, leading to recurring water crises, and damages to local agriculture and food supplies. TAIFA-1 will feature a hyperspectral, Earth-observation camera that will empower customers with relevant environmental, wildlife, and agricultural monitoring as well as land use mapping data in the fight against natural disasters. In addition, EnduroSat and SayariLabs signed an MOU, which is another milestone for the successful partnership and upcoming joint space projects of the two companies. To this end, EnduroSat organised a two-week educational training for SayariLab’s engineering team, dedicated to space systems and engineering, covering all aspects of mission analysis, design, and spacecraft assembly. “Over the past decades, space and satellite industries have been reserved for the wealthy and mighty. However, SayariLabs is on a mission of democratising these industries for all interested players in the African region and in making Kenya a space giant in the next generation. With the advancement of technology, this fantasy is quickly becoming a reality. Our partnership with EnduroSat, a leading company in this industry, is a major game-changer and it strengthens our hope and belief of being a major space and satellite solution provider in Kenya, the African region and other parts of the world.” Aaron Nzau, Founder & CEO SayariLabs. “I am really proud to have the opportunity to support SayariLabs in their efforts to bring space closer to thousands of people in Kenya. Working alongside their team has been an amazing experience for us and I cannot wait to see the innovations and the positive impact that they plan to have, realized in practice. EnduroSat has been for a long time a true believer in open, responsible and accessible space and this is yet another step in this direction.” Raycho Raychev, Founder & CEO EnduroSat.
